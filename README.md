- [House of Web3](https://edgeandnode.com/thehouseofweb3/) - co-working and event space for web3 pioneers and those who contribute knowledge, education, and code to the community at large
- [The Expensify Lounge](https://use.expensify.com/lounge) - Picture a high-end airport lounge mixed with a vibrant co-working space. Sprinkle in some community building for like-minded, get-shit-done individuals and youâ€™ve got the Expensify Lounge! Free for Expensify customers

### Guides

Being in a city is as much a list of things to do and places to go to as it is a mindset and way of life. Here are some articles that help you get into a SF State of Mind.
